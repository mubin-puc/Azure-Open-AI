To continue with our Covid-19 theme, we will be using an open dataset called [\"Covid Tracking Project\"](https://covidtracking.com/data/download). The COVID Tracking Project dataset is a  CSV file that provides the latest numbers on tests, confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and patient outcomes from every US state and territory (they stopped tracking on March 7 2021).\n",

        "The implementation of Agents is inspired by two papers: the [MRKL Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00445) paper (pronounced ‘miracle’ 😉) and the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "Agents are a way to leverage the ability of LLMs to understand and act on prompts. In essence, an Agent is an LLM that has been given a very clever initial prompt. The prompt tells the LLM to break down the process of answering a complex query into a sequence of steps that are resolved one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Agents become really cool when we combine them with ‘experts’, introduced in the MRKL paper. Simple example: an Agent might not have the inherent capability to reliably perform mathematical calculations by itself. However, we can introduce an expert - in this case a calculator, an expert at mathematical calculations. Now, when we need to perform a calculation, the Agent can call in the expert rather than trying to predict the result itself. This is actually the concept behind [ChatGPT Pluggins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, in order to solve the problem \"How do I ask questions to a tabular CSV file\", we need this REACT/MRKL approach, in which we need to instruct the LLM that it needs to use an 'expert/tool' in order to read/load/understand/interact with a CSV tabular file.\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenAI opened the world to a whole new concept. Libraries are being created fast and furious. We will be using [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) as our library to solve this problem, however there are others that we recommend: [HayStack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) and [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/whatissk)."
