The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",

This approach ensures that we allocate funds and resources only when the documents are actually required. Typically, in an organization with a vast repository of documents in a data lake, only 20% of the documents are frequently accessed, while the rest remain untouched.
